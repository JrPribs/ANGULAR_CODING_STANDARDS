# Angular Coding Standards

A comprehensive collection of Angular and TypeScript coding standards designed for consistent, maintainable, and AI-assisted development.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains universal Angular coding standards that can be reused across projects. These standards have been custom-curated by John Pribesh (Angular expert since v1 beta) and represent best practices evolved from real-world Angular applications.

## üéØ Purpose

- **Consistency**: Ensure all Angular projects follow the same architectural patterns
- **AI-Friendly**: Structured for optimal use with AI development tools like Claude
- **Living Document**: Continuously updated based on real-world usage and feedback
- **Battle-Tested**: Standards derived from production Angular applications

## üìö What's Included

### Core Standards Files

- **`angular-cheat-sheet.md`** - Quick reference guide with law codes (CS-R01, CS-C01, etc.)
- **`angular_coding_standards.md`** - The comprehensive 600+ line standards document
- **`angular-state-architecture.md`** - Detailed state management patterns and data flow
- **`angular-state-pattern.mermaid`** - Visual diagram of the one-way state pattern

### Reference Documentation

- **`angular_llms.txt`** - Official Angular team's index for AI tools
- **`angular_llms-full.txt`** - Comprehensive Angular documentation for LLM consumption
- **`documentation-map.md`** - Navigation guide for documentation structure
- **`index.md`** - Directory overview and file descriptions

## üöÄ Using These Standards

### In a New Project

1. Clone this repository or add it as a Git submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add git@github.com:JrPribs/ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS.git CODING_STANDARDS
   ```

2. Create project-specific files:
   - `project-overrides.md` - Document any project-specific deviations
   - `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions for your project

3. Reference the standards in your development workflow

### As a Git Submodule

When using as a submodule, you can:
- Keep standards synchronized across multiple projects
- Update standards independently of project code
- Track which version of standards each project uses

## üìñ Key Principles

1. **Router-First Architecture** - The router is the source of truth
2. **Standalone Components** - Modern Angular without NgModules
3. **One-Way Data Flow** - Component ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Component
4. **Immutable State** - State is read-only at the component level
5. **AI-Assisted Development** - Standards structured for LLM comprehension

## üîß Project-Specific Overrides

Each project using these standards should maintain its own `project-overrides.md` file (not included in this repository) to document any deviations from the standards and why they exist.

## üìù License

These standards are provided as-is for use in Angular projects. Feel free to adapt them to your needs.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration

To integrate these Angular coding standards into an existing project with Claude Code, provide the following prompt:

```
Please integrate the Angular coding standards from https://github.com/JrPribs/ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS into this project:

1. Add the repository as a Git submodule at the path CODING_STANDARDS:
   
   git submodule add git@github.com:JrPribs/ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS.git CODING_STANDARDS

2. Update the CLAUDE.md file to include a reference to these standards. Add the following to the instructions section:

   ## Angular Coding Standards
   
   This project follows the Angular coding standards located in the CODING_STANDARDS directory. 
   Please ensure all code adheres to these standards:
   
   - Review CODING_STANDARDS/angular-cheat-sheet.md for quick reference of law codes
   - Follow patterns in CODING_STANDARDS/angular_coding_standards.md
   - Use state management patterns from CODING_STANDARDS/angular-state-architecture.md
   
   IMPORTANT: Treat these standards as linting rules. Before writing or modifying any Angular code:
   1. Check the relevant law codes in the cheat sheet
   2. Ensure your implementation follows the prescribed patterns
   3. Document any necessary deviations in project-overrides.md

3. Create a project-overrides.md file in the CODING_STANDARDS directory to document any project-specific deviations from the standards.

4. When writing Angular code, always:
   - Reference the law codes (e.g., CS-R01, CS-C01) from the cheat sheet
   - Follow the architectural patterns exactly as specified
   - Treat violations of these standards as errors that must be fixed
   - Only deviate from standards when absolutely necessary and document the reason in project-overrides.md
```

This prompt ensures Claude will treat the coding standards as mandatory linting rules that must be followed throughout the project.
